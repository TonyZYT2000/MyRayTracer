# My Ray Tracer

## Description

This is based on [Peter Shirley](https://github.com/petershirley)'s fantastic tutorial *[Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series](https://raytracing.github.io/)*. I have some modifications based on my own taste. 

## Build

Type `make` in command line to build all targets.

All other make options are listed in the Makefile.

## Artworks!

Here are some artworks created by the ray tracer. They show multiple textures and the effects of reflection and refraction.
