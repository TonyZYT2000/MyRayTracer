# My Ray Tracer

## Description

This is based on [Peter Shirley](https://github.com/petershirley)'s fantastic tutorial *[Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series](https://raytracing.github.io/)*. I have some modifications based on my own taste. 

## Build

Type `mkdir build && cd build` to create the build directory where project will be generated.

- Use `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..` for release build.
- Use `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..` for debug build.

Add flag `-G "Unix Makefiles"` to force generating Makefile project.

## Artworks!

Here are some artworks created by the ray tracer. They show multiple textures and the effects of reflection and refraction.
